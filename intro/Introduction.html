  Hey! My name is Sullivan Tuft and I am from Nampa, Idaho which is just outside of Boise, Idaho. I am majoring in computer science and I love technology. Some of my other hobbies include basketball, music and video games! This is my third semester and I have just returned from the West Virginia, Charleston Mission! I look forward to this class with you all.
One of my favorite scriptures is <br>
<b>Ether 12:27</b> <br>
<b>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make eweak things become strong unto them.</b>

This scripture is one of my favorites just because of how it shows the mercy of God. He doesn't want us to be in pain, but He knows we will fail. This is why he sent his son Jesus Christ to overcome all for mankind.
